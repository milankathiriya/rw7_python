'''
Q.3 Implement a program where a UDF accepts a list of integers and returns the square of each integer in a new list using a list comprehension.
'''

# def square(n):
#     ans = [i**2 for i in n]
#     return ans


# l = [2, 3, 4, 5]

# my_ans = square(l)

# print(my_ans)


'''
Q.4 Write a UDF that takes a string as input and returns the frequency of each character in the string as a dictionary.
'''

# def countFrequency(n):
#     freq = {}

#     for i in n:
#         if i in freq:
#             freq[i] += 1
#         else:
#             freq[i] = 1

#     return freq


# name = input("Enter any name: ")
# ans = countFrequency(name)

# print(ans)
